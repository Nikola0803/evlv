              <p>
                EVLV operates an optional SMS marketing program. Participation is entirely voluntary and is never
                required in order to buy anything from us.

                <strong className="text-charcoal">How we collect consent.</strong> We only send marketing text
                messages to a phone number when the person who owns that number has given express written consent
                by ticking an unchecked opt-in box on our website and submitting it. The box is never pre-ticked,
                and consent to receive text messages is not a condition of any purchase. Consent to receive email
                does not carry over to SMS, and we do not treat it as though it does.

                <strong className="text-charcoal">What we record as proof of consent.</strong> When you opt in we

                agent of the device used, the page the consent was given on, and a version identifier for the exact
                consent wording shown to you at that moment. We retain this record for as long as you remain
                subscribed and for at least five years after you opt out, so that we can evidence your consent if
                asked.
