/**
 * The homepage's "Featured products" carousel is scraped static HTML
 * (landing-content.json, see page.tsx's big doc comment) with prices
 * hand-typed in at scrape time -- they silently drift from the real,
 * live shop prices whenever a price changes there. This patches each
 * product card's <div class="pprice"> in place with the real current
 * price plus a crossed-out anchor price (same 20%-off convention as
 * ProductCard.tsx's getAnchorPrice()), so the homepage always matches
 * the shop instead of needing a second manual edit on every price change.
 *
 * Deliberately a targeted regex substitution over the scraped markup
 * rather than a rebuilt template -- every product's badge/description/
 * feature-bullet copy in that HTML is real, reviewed marketing copy that
 * has nothing to do with pricing, and shouldn't be reconstructed from
 * scratch here (or silently dropped) just to fix a number.

// Small pill row for the other doses of a product (5mg/10mg/20mg etc) --
// same reasoning as the identical addition to ProductCard.tsx: without
// this, a visitor has to open the product page just to find out other
// sizes exist. Only the currently-featured size links out; a visitor
// who wants a different dose clicks through, same as the shop grid.
// Renders as plain <span>s, NOT <a> links -- the whole homepage carousel
// card (see applyLiveFeaturedPricing below) is already one big <a
// class="product"> wrapper scraped from the approved mockup. A nested <a>
// inside an <a> is invalid HTML; browsers silently split the outer anchor
// where the inner one starts, which is what was breaking these cards
// (missing price/description/button, or a fragmented empty card) for any
// product with 2+ variants. These pills are indicator-only here -- picking
// a different size still works, just from the /shop grid or the product
// page (both use ProductCard.tsx, which gives each pill its own real
// non-nested link).
