// POST /api/heroes-discount/request { name, email, status, branch, proofFileName,
// proofFileType, proofFileDataUrl } — proxies to the CRM's
// /api/store/heroes-discount/request. Manually reviewed, like the affiliate
// program: reviewer checks the attached proof of service (ID/DD-214/badge
// photo, sent as a data URL) before approving. On approval the CRM issues a
// personal, single-use 20%-off Coupon (PERCENT, amount: 20) and emails the
// code — reuses the same Coupon model checkout already validates against,
// no new discount mechanism needed. Non-stackable is inherent: checkout
// only ever reads one couponCode field, so this can never combine with
// another code. Doesn't exist on the CRM yet — needs a Coupon row created
// per approved request, storage for the proof-of-service upload (the data
// URL is a few MB at most given the 8MB client-side cap; store it as a
// file/blob, not inline in a row), plus the same "no transactional email"
// gap flagged in REFERRAL-PROGRAM.md / AFFILIATE-PORTAL.md.
