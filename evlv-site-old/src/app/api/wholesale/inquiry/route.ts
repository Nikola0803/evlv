// be reviewed and followed up manually (sales conversation, not automated
// onboarding), so the CRM side just needs to land these somewhere visible
// (e.g. a Lead/Inquiry table, or route into the existing SupportTicket
// inbox with a distinct channel) rather than a full workflow. Doesn't exist
// on the CRM yet.
